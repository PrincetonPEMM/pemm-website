Fol. 71b.] NOW there was a certain man who was washing his clothes in a stream, and another man came and turned aside the water thereof into another channel. And the man who was washing his clothes said unto that man, By the prayer of our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, the God-bearer, let this water alone; but the man filched away the water in spite of him, and cursing him that was washing his clothes twice and thrice refused to let the water alone. And at that moment the running water turned backwards and flowed up the hill, and all the people gathered together [to see it] and they marvelled at what had taken place. And the water continued to flow up the hill for many days, and then, by the Will of God, the river returned to its former bed. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

    "english_translation": "Budge, Legends, pages 61-80; during the flight to Egypt, the Holy Family visited the town of Qosqam (modern al-Qusiya). The nearby monastery, named Deir al-Muḥarraq, is a pilgrimage site for this, which inspired the church Dabra Qwasqwam in the 1700s in Gondar. Ucin summarizes: the emperor Theodosius the Great sent the patriarch Theophilus in Upper Egypt to confiscate the treasures of the pagan temples and to use them for building churches. On his way  back to Alexandria, Theophilus stops to pray in the Monastery of the Virgin in Qosqam. During the night, the patriarch has a vision, in which Virgin Mary recounts to him the sojourn of the Holy Family in Egypt for three years, five months and three days. ... it embeds various literary topoi which appear as well in the Protoevangelium of James, the Arabic Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew and other apocryphal nativity and infancy narratives: it introduces the midwife Salome as companion of the Holy Family to Egypt; the encounter between the Holy Family and the two thieves which shall be crucified later with Jesus; the statues of the idols of Hermopolis Magna (al-Ashmunein), which fell down and broke to pieces when the child Jesus passed them; the tree which bowed down to worship Christ; the miraculous powers of the spring in which the divine child was bathing. ... The sermon ends with a note allegedly written by Cyril of Alexandria, who claims to be the one who wrote down Theophilus’ words. Originally written in Coptic. Long and short version; Budge did short, the one that most often appears in TM. [Possibly use this [Jeremy thinks not, because it was so confused, markers stripped out that it was part of a vision story, whose the narrator, kept switching between first and third]: (translated by Dawit and Jeremy) (EMML 329) image 202A. Mary said (and what follows is by her, although first person and third person keeps changing): Two thieves pass on the road, one from x and one from Egypt, and they talk about the Virgin Mary, and the royal clothes of jesus, so when they/I encountered them in the desert/wilderness, the thief, caused them to encounter them, narrating a story, however they were close to a city, and the Egyptian said to the other one/ass, the thieves see the holy family and they want to take their clothing because it seems like royal clothing, big bird, let us go, because I have not seen a child like this, since I was created, until this, and while they were speaking like this, Christ spoke out wisdom from his mouth, I want to drink, and I saw and put in and I arose and I led him into the city and I asked the women give him a drink of water, and there wasn't any to give because the city people did not have mercy, and the robbers saw that I went into the city and they came after them, and they went to Joseph while he was sleeping, said to him, arise, we will go from the city because they are bereft of mercy and I will seek water that they did not give me and I was [scraps 321-325 go into city, mean people, don't get water, sleeping Joseph, came down] spring flowing and we drank like it was honey and milk and let this water be for all who drinks it and passing healing, let healing pass, and let healing happen, not for the people of this city because let there be bitterness in their mouths, let not one of them live, and we ate a little bit, and I carried the beloved son, and we arose so that we might go and at that time, and none of them remained and we destroyed their idols in each of their places and thus the idols of Egypt, Dagon, all idols fall down [ID 431]  maybe the story is created to connect the Cannibal of Qemer to the thieves at the cross, linking it to the spring cycle, and connected to the Holy Family and the thieves and maybe the spring story; cannibal's name doesn't come up, but in this story it has the Holy Family them receiving water, so perhaps a connection to Cannibal of Qemer story] See also the translation by Augustine Dickinson at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pekMjkw3W_xMDphBFPaH2F2VoUuq2N3y/view?fbclid=IwAR0dLp1aO8hWQf8AhgIreYtuGPO_OM8u60_IY9ZfMfqufMWiTXcNbdEMDwo",
