  "english_translation": "Budge, Rowan translation; I BISHOP DEXIUS AND THE VIRGIN MARY [A. Fol. 3a, 1; B. Fol. 9a, 1; Orient. 652, Fol. 2b.] NOW there was a certain Bishop in the church of Teltelya whose name was Dexius, and he was a righteous man and a fearer of God, and he loved our Lady Mary exceedingly. His mouth declared her praise, and his heart was filled with thoughts of her, and he ministered unto her with exceedingly great diligence and care; and he wrote the Book of her Miracles and History, and he ceased not to meditate upon the same at eventide and at morn. And it came to pass that when he came nigh to finishing the writing of her praises, our Lady the Virgin Mary, the Majesty of Christian people, brought unto him glad tidings openly, and she said unto him, Give me the Book of my History and Miracles, which my beloved son hath made, into my hands. And she took the Book of her Miracles, and she opened it and read therein; and she was exceedingly pleased therewith. And she said unto him, Behold, O my beloved, thou hast toiled for me. Behold now, I am well pleased with thee and I give thanks unto thee, and the blessing of my beloved Son shall be upon thee and shall dwell in thy house, and He shall bless thy children and those that shall be descended from thee with the blessing of heaven, because thou hast written this Book for me; and having said these words she disappeared from him. And the Bishop rejoiced with an exceeding great joy because Mary had brought him glad tidings, and had shown herself unto him openly, and had spoken unto him mouth to mouth; Miracles of the Virgin Mary and he loved her the more and his heart was smitten with deep love for her. Then he meditated in his heart and said, Behold, I will exalt her honour and majesty, and I will add thereunto very much more than I have been wont to do aforetime. And he made a great festival, the like of which man had never made, in commemoration of Mary, not on the day of her glorious nativity, but before it, and he chose one day of all the days, and established the celebration of all the festival upon it, and he made regulations concerning it and confirmed it. And all the people of the city celebrate the festival unto this day according to the ordinance of the Bishop, and they keep the feast of the commemoration of Mary with joy and gladness.
